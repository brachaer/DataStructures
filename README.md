# Data Structures Box Factory project (C# WPF - Dictionary Implementation)

Welcome to the Data Structures Box Factory project, a C# implementation using the powerful Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. This project showcases the adept use of data structures, specifically a dictionary, to orchestrate an efficient and dynamic simulation of a box factory.

## Key Features
**Dictionary Implementation:** Leveraging C#'s versatile dictionaries to manage and manipulate boxes seamlessly within the factory simulation.

**WPF Framework:** Utilizing the Windows Presentation Foundation for creating a visually engaging and interactive user interface.

**Box Factory Simulation:** A comprehensive project that provides a real-world simulation of a box factory, demonstrating the effective use of data structures in managing various box-related operations.

## Skills Demonstrated
**C# Programming:** Showcasing proficiency in C# language features and best practices.

**WPF Development:** Crafting an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using the Windows Presentation Foundation.

**Data Structure Implementation:** Expertly implementing a dictionary data structure for efficient box management.

**Algorithm Design:** Demonstrating strategic algorithm design to optimize box-related operations within the factory simulation.
